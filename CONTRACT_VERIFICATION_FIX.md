# Contract Verification Error Fix

## Problem
The SelfProtocolVerification component was throwing an error:
```
Error checking verification status: Error: could not decode result data (value="0x", info={ "method": "isUserVerified", "signature": "isUserVerified(address)" }, code=BAD_DATA, version=6.15.0)
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by **network mismatch**:

1. **Wrong Network**: The frontend was trying to call the contract on Celo mainnet (or whatever network the user's wallet was connected to), but the contract was actually deployed to **Celo Sepolia testnet**.

2. **Contract Address**: `0xa46fbeC38d888c37b4310a145745CF947d83a0eB` exists only on Celo Sepolia testnet (Chain ID: 11142220), not on mainnet.

3. **Empty Bytecode**: When calling a contract address that doesn't exist on the current network, the blockchain returns empty bytecode (`0x`), causing the "could not decode result data" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Network Detection
- Added automatic detection of the current network chain ID
- Compare against expected Celo Sepolia chain ID (11142220)
- Show clear error message when on wrong network

### 2. Network Switching
- Added `switchToCeloSepolia()` function to help users switch networks
- Automatically adds Celo Sepolia network if it doesn't exist in the user's wallet
- Provides RPC URL and block explorer information

### 3. Updated ABI
- Updated the contract ABI to match the actual deployed contract
- Added proper error handling for contract calls

### 4. Better Error Messages
- Clear indication when on wrong network
- Detailed debugging information in console logs
- User-friendly UI for network switching

## Contract Details
- **Network**: Celo Sepolia Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 11142220
- **Contract Address**: `0xa46fbeC38d888c37b4310a145745CF947d83a0eB`
- **RPC URL**: `https://forno.celo-sepolia.celo-testnet.org`
- **Block Explorer**: `https://celo-sepolia.blockscout.com/`

## Verification
Contract method can be tested with:
```bash
cast call 0xa46fbeC38d888c37b4310a145745CF947d83a0eB "isUserVerified(address)" "0x22861655b864Bdb2675F56CDa9D35EE2a2d6bF3c" --rpc-url https://forno.celo-sepolia.celo-testnet.org
```

Returns: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001` (true)

## User Experience
1. When users connect their wallet, the app automatically detects if they're on the wrong network
2. If on wrong network, shows a clear UI with:
   - Network switch button
   - Network details (Chain ID, RPC URL)
   - Instructions for manual setup
3. Only proceeds with verification once on correct network

## Files Modified
- `dapp/src/components/SelfProtocolVerification.tsx`: Updated with network detection and switching logic
- Added proper contract ABI and error handling

## Next Steps
1. Test the component with a wallet connected to different networks
2. Verify that network switching works correctly
3. Ensure the Self Protocol verification flow works end-to-end on Celo Sepolia
4. Consider deploying to mainnet for production use
